## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.
